Queen Alice!　It's morning![n]
Please wake up already![p]
#Alice

Umm...[n]
Wait, what?  Right...morning.[p]
#Cheshire

Queen Alice, I'm coming in.[p]

Waaa! Y...you wouldnt really do that to me, would you?![p]

[voice ref="000009"]
Jeez!  Just wait outside![p]

Having been confusedly awoken by [n]
Cheshire's shouting, Alice squirmed [n]
out of bed.[p]
#Alice
[voice ref="000010"]
Haaaaaah![p]
[cn]
After stretching and taking off her pajamas,[n]
she took out her favorite dress from the wardrobe.[p]
#Alice
[voice ref="000011"]
Alrighty then.[p]
[cn]
Lastly, Alice put on her hat, smiled in the mirror pleased 
with her outfit before leaving the room humming happily.[p]

After a lunch break, we'll return[n]

Please have a good reason this time...[p]

Since becoming the ruler, the only 'work'[n]
you do is attending banquets organized by[n]
others and only if alcohol is being served.[p]

[voice ref="000017"]
Look, I just can't do work that's so[n]

alcohol is delicious. [p]
#Cheshire

Please don't say such selfish things. It makes[n]

Don't act so suprised! What's going on with 
this draft budget?! I was going to bring it up 
at today's meeting, but I can't wait that long!![p]
[voice ref="000022"]
Why is 60% of the budget under "other"?![n]
What the heck is "other"? You need to be more specific![p]
[changecg id=0 state=0]
#Alice
[voice ref="000023"]
It's things like sweets, alcohol, some sort of weird medicine, and...[n]

An unfamiliar, sickeningly sweet smell had wafted in.[p]

My body feels heavy and my head is foggy. [p]

[filter name="clear" time="500"]

#Alice
[voice ref="000042"]
What...is...this?[p]
[cn]
When I opened my eyelids, a luxurious lace curtain appeared before my eyes. [p]
#Alice
[voice ref="000043"]
I'm in a bed?[n]
[changecg id=0 state=2]
Uh...hm. My shoulders are strangely stiff for some reason.[p]

Alice had awoken in a luxurious canopy bed. [p]
[changecg id=0 state=0]
#Alice
[voice ref="000044"]
This isn't...my mansion
...hmm, I went to town, walked around some street stalls, and then there was a meeting...[n]
Wait, I don't remember...[p]
[drawcg id=3 pos="left" dir="right"]

Ah, you're awake now.[p]

[voice ref="000046"]
Hm?[n]
[changecg id=0 state=2]
...Who's there? [p]
[cn]
The voice came from the side of the bed. [p]
It seems that a woman had been watching Alice from there the whole time.[p]
#Veronica
[voice ref="000047"]
It seems your memory is still a bit hazy.[p]
[voice ref="000048"]
I am Veronica.[n]
The Great Witch Veronica. [p]
#Alice
[voice ref="000049"]
Great witch...?[n]
...That's some kind of impressive title, huh? [p]
[voice ref="000050"]
More than that, just where is this place?[n]
It doesn't seem to be my mansion...or town... [p]
#Veronica
[voice ref="000051"]
This is my palace.[n]
You followed me all the way here, didn't you?[p]

Hehe, the toilet was just a lie! Shall I just play around in town and go home?[p]

Ah? ...Who are you, speaking so proudly?[n]
Don't you know who I am? Or is this a mistake?[p]
#Veronica
[voice ref="000056"]
Oh, I'm sorry.[n]
I am Veronica, a witch who is your teacher's apprentice.[p]
[voice ref="000056a"]
We haven't seen each other since you were little, so[n]
...you don't remember me, right?[p]
#Alice
[voice ref="000057"]
Veronica? Fellow apprentice?[n]
[changecg id=0 state=0]
Hey, I was the first apprentice of Babaa![n]
Don't lie to me.[p]
#Veronica
[voice ref="000058"]
I see...is that so?[n]
It seems like my master hasn't been talking about me.[p]
#Alice
[voice ref="000059"]
...I haven't heard anything.[n]
I mean, there shouldn't be any witches named Veronica in our territory to begin with...[p]
#Veronica
[voice ref="000060"]
I am the ruler of the northern lands.[n]
It's not surprising that you wouldn't know about me as the north is inaccessible from here.[p]
[changecg id=0 state=1]
#Alice
[voice ref="000061"]
Oh, so you're from the Northlands![n]
Hey, what are the Northlands like?[n]
And how did you get here from the Northlands?[n]
I heard there are high mountains blocking the way.[p]
#Veronica
[voice ref="000062"]
Are you interested in the Northern Land?[n]
I came here using warp magic, but it's only for one person...[p]
[move id=0 x=-10 time=300]
#Alice
[voice ref="000063"]
Hey, take me with that warp magic![n]
If it's magic, you'll be back soon, right?[p]
#Veronica
[voice ref="000064"]
Well, that may be true...[n]
But since I've never cast it on anyone else, I don't know what will happen. [p]
#Alice
[voice ref="000065"]
Come on, come on! It's not like we're going to die, right?[n]
I'm just really bored right now.[n]
Take me with you quickly![p]
#Veronica

Ah! That's it, that's it![n]
So, that warp magic looks like it really takes a toll on you.[n]
Then, this must be the Northland![p]
#Veronica
[voice ref="000068"]
It is, but...Alice, aren't you a little careless?[n]
Despite being a witch, you're still a girl,

Yeah, it's disrespectful, Veronica![p]
#Ryza
[voice ref="000078"]
Just because you're a great witch doesn't mean you get to act all superior...[n]
Every day you just keep teaching us these low-level basic magic spells.[p]
Magic to turn a tree sprout into a full tree... Who the hell would use that?!![p]

Capture and execution![n]
Then, we will claim the title of great witch![p]

A great witch is not one who merely declares oneself as such![n]
