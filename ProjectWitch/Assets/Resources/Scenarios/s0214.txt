#Alice
[voice ref="020505"]
Tch, they're such yellow bellied chickens. They turned tail and ran after only a few skirmishes.[p]
#Kuro
[voice ref="020506"]
No, the ice witch likely has sound judgment, and it's probably thanks to her quick grasp of the situation that she was able to save the lives of her troops.[p]
[voice ref="020507"]
Her main objective was probably to rescue the remaining troops at the fortress.[p]
#Alice
[voice ref="020508"]
So it seems it's too early for a decisive battle.[n]
[changecg id=1 state=1]
That's fine.[p]
[voice ref="020508a"]
I'll play your game and chase you...all the way to your doorstep.[n]
Kufufufufufu![p]
