Right flank, deploy right away![n]
Left flank, keep moving forward!![p]
[voice ref="020659a"]
You won't be able to break through our lines like last time!![p]
[cn]
Torianna's strategy seemed the same as last time. [p]
She flanked Alice's army on three sides, and all that was left was for Carton to attack from behind as before.[p]
But that did not happen this time.[p]
Torianna intentionally left an opening at the rear of Alice's army.[p]
#Torianna's subordinate
[voice ref="020660"]
Unleash the might of the magic squad!!![p]

[cn]
Countless fireballs rain down from Torianna's army.[p]
Confused by the fireballs,[n]
Alice's soldiers flee to the rear.[p]
#Alice
[voice ref="020661"]
Ah! Hey!! Don't run to the back!! It's a trap!![n]
Wanna die!!![p]
[cn]
Alice understood the purpose of this formation.[p]
Soldiers who slipped out from the open rear would be struck down by the bows and arrows of Carton's squads waiting out of sight.[p]
Even though she knew this, once caught in this situation, there was no alternative but to break through the front.[p]
However, despite their determined charge,[n]
they couldn't break through Torianna's ranks.[p]
Alice's forces were outnumbered on this day.[p]
...Alice had foreseen that it would turn out like this.[p]
#Alice
[voice ref="020662"]
Damn, if I don't bring it soon, things will get dangerous.[n]
I was thinking of holding out a little longer, but...[p]
[voice ref="020663"]
Hey, give the signal!![p]
[cn]
At Alice's command,[n]
a magical flare was launched into the sky.[p]
That was the signal.[p]

Wha- What did you say?![p]
#Torianna
[voice ref="020666"]
Behind us!![p]
#Marugeru
[voice ref="020666a"]
We're surrounded![p]
[cn]
The battleground was not as flat as it had appeared to be.[p]
Alice's soldiers suddenly appeared from under the ground revealing a hollow where they had lied in wait.[p]
[scale id=1 sx=-1 time=0]
#Torianna
[voice ref="020667"]
That's absurd![p]
[voice ref="020667a"]
There was no sign of the troops being divided on the way here.[n]
So how...?! [p]
#Alice
[voice ref="020668"]
Kufufufuu!![n]
We didn't split up...[p]
[voice ref="020668a"]
I prepared this in advance.[p]
[cn]
Alice had hidden her troops the day before.[p]
As the locations that would likely become the battlefield could be easily identified, it was a strategy that could be employed.[p]
#Alice
[voice ref="020669"]
Kufufufufuu![n]
Alright, let's go, you guys, it's time for the counterattack!![p]
