#Alice
Hey, They've got 0 soldiers and aren't dead.[p]
[drawfg id=1]
#Kuro
That's the number of soliders under their command.[n]
It doesn't include the captain.[p]
To destroy a unit, you must also defeat the captain![p]
[drawfg id=0 state=1]
#Alice
I see. Then ＨＰ is the captain's strength![p]
[drawfg id=1]
#Kuro
That's right. 
Basically, you cannot attack the captain while they have soldiers remaining.[p]

If a unit is wiped out, the captain is defeated or killed.[p]
Please note that if a unit dies, it will not be revived.[p]
Also, if your majesty collapses, the battle will end.[p]
Please be careful...[p]

Oh!　You can also capture them?[p]
[drawfg id=1]
#Kuro
Capture allows you to capture the enemy without killing them.[p]
The captured captain will do as your majesty pleases...[p]

#Alice
Of course, I'll use them as my servant![p]

#Kuro
Some of them still have loyalty to their former masters, so they will not be so easily...[p]

If they're not witches, I'll use subjugation magic to control them![p]

Ah...you truly are the Queen Alice I know.[p]
Then when you capture them, do...[p]
