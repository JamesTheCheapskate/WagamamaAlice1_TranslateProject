[voice ref="020485"]
What's going on? What's with all the yelling?[p]
[cn]
Toriana and her friends were having a tea party like the three of them always did.[p]
Without warning, a subordinate abruptly rushed in disturbing their gathering like a storm cloud.[p]

The flower witch Alice has appeared near the border and has apparently launched an attack against us![p]

#Torianna
[voice ref="020489"]
...I want you to conscript soldiers from the towns of Pinot and Ice.[p]
[voice ref="020489a"]
Each fortress's commander should leave behind a minimal force and gather everyone at the Sherbet Fortress.[p]
#Subordinate
[voice ref="020490"]
Ah, understood.[n]
Please excuse me![p]

We've been caught off guard...
I didn't expect them to suddenly attack us.[p]
[voice ref="020492"]
Olivia, go back to your territory and prepare your army.
You never know when the enemy might move in your direction.[p]
#Olivia
[voice ref="020493"]
Y-yeah...Got it.[p]

Helen.[n]
I want you to come back as soon as you've escorted Olivia home.[p]

When the situation arose, Torianna immediately sprung into action.[p]
With her quick judgement, she swiftly rallied her troops.[p]
Torianna's army as by no means highly trained.[p]
There were only a few professional soldiers while the majority were conscripted townspeople.[p]
However, the strength of her army lay in her command.[p]

Let's show them what we're capable of by keeping this momentum and conquering their territory in a single battle.[p]

Alice's army approached the gates of Sherbert Fortress.[p]
Already, Alice's forces had climbed over the walls of the fortress and began trampling through the interior. [p]
It seemed only a matter of time before the fortress would fall.[p]
In fact, at this point, the Torianna's army had only about 500 soldiers, while the Alice's army, including their reserves, had a massive force of over 5,000 soldiers.[p]
The fortress appeared to be on the brink of collapse.[p]
However, at that moment, Torianna, who had gathered soldiers at an unbelievable speed, arrived.[p]

Nah,  it doesn't matter. No matter how many reinforcements come, it's already too late. 
Look, the gates are opening![p]
[voice ref="020503"]
All troops, charge! 
Slaughter the enemy soldiers![p]

A full-scale clash between the two armies has begun.[p]
