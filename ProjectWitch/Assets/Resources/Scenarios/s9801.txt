Queen Alice, please choose a unit you want to deploy for battle.[p]
[drawfg id=0 state="0"]
#Alice
You tell me to choose, but...[p]
Can't we just attack with all our troops?[p]
[drawfg id=1]
#Cheshire
Y-You can't do that! We need to leave some troops to defend our territory...[p]
Also, due to the size of the battlefield, you can only deploy up to three units at a time.[p]

#Alice
Geez...So I have to choose.[p]

What does this whole vanguard, middle guard, and rear guard stuff mean?[p]
[drawfg id=1]
#Cheshire
Vanguards take more damage, while rear guards take less.[p]
Conversely, units that use physical attacks will do more damage in the Vanguard and less in the rear guard.[p]
Physical units tend to have higher troop counts and defense than magic units.[p]
[drawfg id=0 state="1"]
#Alice
So, I should prioritize placing physical units in the vanguard and magic units in the rear guard, right?[p]
[drawfg id=1]
#Cheshire
Yes! That's correct.[p]
[drawfg id=0 state="0"]
#Alice
So, how do I place them?[p]

#Cheshire
Yes, units can be placed by selecting any unit from this unit list.[p]
They will be placed in the order you select as vanguard, middle guard, and rear guard, so be careful.[p]

#Alice
What are those cards next to it?[p]
[drawfg id=1]
#Cheshire
Right. Those offer various type of battle support.[p]
For example, if you have a "Spade I" card, you can release a Fireball to deal damage to the enemy.[p]
[drawfg id=0 state="1"]
#Alice
Wow! I'll use something so useful nonstop![p]
[drawfg id=1]
#Cheshire
Of course we want you to do so, but unfortunately there is a limit to the number of times a card can be used.
[p]
Cards used in battle will be gone at the end of the battle.[p]

Whaa!  What a pain in the...[p]
[drawfg id=1]

Yeah, so you have to think about how to best use them.[p]
Cards can be selected just like units.[p]
