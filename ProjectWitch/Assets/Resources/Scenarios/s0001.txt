#Alice
[voice ref="000121"]
...~sigh~[p]
#Veronica
[voice ref="000122"]
Oh! Did you wake up?[p]
[changecg id=0 state=2]
#Alice
[voice ref="000123"]
You're...Veronica.[n]
Hey, where are we...?[p]
#Veronica
[voice ref="000124"]
It's an underground cell.[n]
...You were brought here a little while ago[n]
by Ryza.[p]
[move id=0 y=5 time=50]
[move id=0 y=-5 time=50]
#Alice
[changecg id=0 state=6]
[voice ref="000125"]
Oh! That's right![n]
That animal...she called me...crybaby Alice[n]
among other things.[p]
#Veronica
[voice ref="000126"]
Alice, I'm sorry...[n]
that you ended up getting involved.[p]
[changecg id=0 state=0]
#Alice
[voice ref="000127a"]
Tch, totally. [p]
[voice ref="000127b"]
Especially when I thought I could see the[n]
land of the north.[n]
Those guys a little while ago, who in the[n]
world were they?[p]
[voice ref="000127c"]
You...were you betrayed?[p]
#Veronica
[voice ref="000128"]
I thought that teaching attack magic was[n]
unnecessary in this peaceful world.[p]
[voice ref="000128a"]
I've been teaching them basic incantations[n]
that can be used in daily life...[p]
[voice ref="000129"]
But, it seems like they were dissatisfied with[n]
that.[p]
#Alice
[voice ref="000130"]
You're a pretty weird person, too.[p]
[voice ref="000131"]
Even our ultra pacifist old woman of a[n]
teacher taught me her secret attack[n]
incantation when I begged her. [p]
#Veronica
[voice ref="000132"]
Our esteemed teacher...?[n]
Is that so, our teacher did that...?[p]
[changecg id=0 state=0]
#Alice
[voice ref="000133"]
...?[n]
Why are you so surprised?[p]
#Veronica
[voice ref="000134"]
No, it's nothing.[n]
Well, we need to think about escaping from[n]
here before anything else.[p]
#Alice
[voice ref="000135"]
Is there a secret passageway or something?[p]
#Veronica
[voice ref="000136"]
There is no such thing inside this prison cell...[p]
[voice ref="000137"]
However, in the corridor, there is an opening[n]
we can use that leads to the forest outside[n]
the palace.[n]
That is, if we can escape from this cell.[p]
#Alice
[voice ref="000138"]
If we can escape from the prison cell...[n]
[changecg id=0 state=1]
...Hey, Veronica.[n]
I just thought of something...[p]

[voice ref="000140"]
Whoa, whoa, why are you being so loud all[n]
of a sudden?[n]
What's wrong?[p]
[voice ref="000141"]
If your stomach hurts, shouldn't you go to[n]
that hole over there?[p]

I already blew chunks everywhere in that[n]
hole![n]
I threw up everything there is, but my[n]
stomach still hurts so bad![p]
[voice ref="000143"]
I've got some horribly strange disease! That's[n]
totally got to be it!![p]
[scale id=1 sx=-1 time=200]
#Veronica
[voice ref="000144"]
That must be it.[n]
It might be a side effect of using warp magic[n]
earlier...[p]
[voice ref="000145"]
Nia, please show some mercy and take Alice[n]
to a doctor![n]
She has nothing to do with our conflict,[n]
right?[p]
#Nia
[voice ref="000146"]
Hmmm, I see. That's right isn't it. Yep, yep.[n]
I know how you feel. When I ate some cured[n]
mackeral I bought in town, I couldn't eat[n]
for three days. It was so painful, yep, yep.[p]

Hmm? Did you say something?[p]
[scale id=1 sx=-1 time=100]
#Veronica

Ah, no. Nothing...[p]
#Alice
[voice ref="000150"]
Uoooooo, it hurts sooo baaaad!![p]
[move id=2 x=20 time=400]
#Nia
[voice ref="000151"]
Hmm, something seems fishy.[n]
You're not trying to trick me, are you?[p]
[voice ref="000152"]
(Would it be fine for me to just kill you right[n]
here? Ryza would totally get angry at me[n]
later though.)[p]
#Veronica
[voice ref="000153"]
There's no way that's true![n]
L-Look...Alice is hurting so much, after all.[p]
#Alice
[voice ref="000154"]
Ugh, I'm about to...It might not make it...[n]
Uu!!![p]

It's okay, hey, let's go quickly.[p]

No, actually, this isn't good... for you[n]
[changecg id=0 state=1]

Alice's destruction beam hit Nia,[p]

#Alice
[voice ref="000162"]
Hehe, falling for such a simple trick.[n]
You're so gullible.[p]
#Veronica
[voice ref="000163"]
I think that was fairly dangerous, but...[p]
[changecg id=0 state=2]
#Alice
[voice ref="000164"]
That's enough about that.[n]
Hey, quickly get us to the escape path.[p]

After escaping from the palace, they joined[n]
forces with the military directly under[n]
Veronica's command, and arrived safely at[n]
the western castle during the night.[p]
#Veronica
[voice ref="000167a"]
Alice, I've caused you a lot of trouble,[n]
haven't I?[p]
[voice ref="000168"]
My promise to guide you through the[n]
northern lands has been thwarted, and it's[n]
pitiful that I'm calling myself a great witch.[p]
[changecg id=0 state=1]
#Alice
[voice ref="000169"]
Hmph! Don't blame yourself for this mess.[n]
Quickly kill those fools and graciously[n]
welcome me back as the most honored[n]
of guests.[p]
[voice ref="000170"]
It'd be nice if there were some good drinks,[n]
food, and some interesting entertainment.[p]
#Veronica
[voice ref="000171"]
Haha...Yes, I undertand.[n]
I'll make sure to think of something special.[p]

Alice...Please take care.[p]

Veronica struggles to breath, gasping[n]

#Veronica
My magical power at level 1 is a bit too[n]
weak now, isn't it?[p]
[voice ref="000175"]
...I won't be able to use warp magic for[n]
some time.[n]
Alice...[p]

Veronica looked out over the eastern land.[p]
In the distance, she could see dust rising[n]
from the plains.[p]
An army of more than 200,000 was[n]
approaching her castle...[p]

So, uh...that was pretty rough.[p]

Alice meets with Cheshire and her other[n]

exploits.[p]

[voice ref="000177"]
The events you describe are so fantastical...[n]
I'm having a hard time believing something[n]
like that happened in the north lands.[p]

I'm relieved to hear that her highness Queen[n]
Veronica is safe.[p]

Oy, Kuro! You knew about her already?! [p]

Kuro: One of Alice's retainers, he has been a[n]

previous ruler, for many years.[p]
#Kuro

Yes, she's visited the mansion several times [n]
while you've been out in town.[p]
[changecg id=0 state=0]
#Alice
[voice ref="000181"]
Tch, you should tell me things like this[n]
sooner![p]
#Cheshire
[voice ref="000182"]
By the way Queen Alice,[n]
some things have happened while you[n]
weren't here.[p]
#Alice
[voice ref="000183"]
Things? What sort of things?[p]
#Kuro
[voice ref="000184"]
Queen Alice, just a little while ago Minister[n]
Maisie apparently led an army and captured[n]
Assam Fortress.[p]
[changecg id=0 state=2]
#Alice
[voice ref="000185"]
Captured? Don't be ridiculous, that's MY[n]
territory.[p]
#Cheshire

...There's a note for you from Minister[n]
Maisie.[p]

"What were you thinking, elder sister?[p]

You don't do the work of a lord, inflate the[n] 
budget with private expenses, sleep at town[n]
meetings, and you even disappeared in the[n]
middle of a meeting...[p]
I can't put up with it anymore.[p]
[voice ref="000190"]
I will manage our honorable teacher's lands.[n]
I'll take care of them since you will not!"[p]

Kuro! Gather the remaining troops!![p]

From now on, mercilessly kill those to defect[n]
to Maisie![p]
[voice ref="000194"]
I'll use my entire army to beat that traitor to[n]
