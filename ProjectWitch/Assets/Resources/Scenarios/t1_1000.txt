#Alice
Oh.[p]
[cn]
The best bar in town. "BAR TOLEBOW."[p]
Good variety of drinks. Good food and cheap prices. 
It is a place for common people to relax.[p]
#Alice
The only drawback is that the owner has dead fish eyes and chest hair, and is a strangely half-baked character.[p]
#Owner
You know I can hear you, right?[p]
#Alice
Oh yeah. Most of the food at this restaurant is good. 
Except the pork cutlet salad udon is very bad.[p]
Never order it.[p]
#Owner
I told you, I can hear you![p]
[changecg id=0 state=1]
#Alice
Hmm. I'm trying to explain this place to Cheshire.[p]
He needs the unfiltered truth for that.[p]

#Cheshire
S-Sorry Barkeep.[p]
Queen Alice is always...[p]
#Owner
I swear.[n]
She comes here all the time only to order cheap drinks, 
and swear at me all day long.[p]
[changecg id=0 state=2]
#Alice
What's that![n]
I'm a customer![p]
#Owner
You think the customer is God?[p]
If you're a god, it's only one of pestilence, you idiot![p]
[move id=0 x=5 time=50]
#Alice
What the hell?[n]
Insult a witch and you'll get burned![p]
#Owner
Heh, go ahead and try![p]
#Alice
You asked for it![n]
Destruction...![p]

Waaah![n]
Queen Alice, stop right there! Stop I say![p]
[scale id=1 sx=-1 time=300]
Barkeep, you know that Queen Alice has a commoner's tongue and a bad drinking habit. 
I don't think she's intentionally sticking with cheap drinks, so please forgive her...[p]
#Alice
Cheshire, whose side are you on?[p]
#Owner
Well, when you're here, it does draw in some customers.[p]
So, it's not all bad overall...[p]
[changecg id=0 state=1]
#Alice
See!　You hear that, Cheshire![n]
I'm not so bad![p]
#Owner
Argh![p]
I think I may have been too nice here.[p]

W-Well, well![p]
[scale id=1 sx=-1 time=300]
Would you like to eat something?[n]
Queen Alice, come on, tell me if there's anything you recommend.[p]
[changecg id=0 state=0]
#Alice
Hmm?　Oh.[p]
Let's see. First of all, let's start with pickled tripe...[p]
#Owner
(Haa...My stomach hurts when this woman comes in...)[p]
