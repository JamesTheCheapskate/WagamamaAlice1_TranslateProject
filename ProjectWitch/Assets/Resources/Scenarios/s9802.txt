Alright！！　It's war time.[p]
Kufufufufu!！！　It's getting fun![p]
[drawfg id=1]
#Kuro
Queen Alice、I'm sorry to interrupt your fun, but I'm waiting for your orders.[p]
[drawfg id=0 state=0]
#Alice
Orders? Can't everyone just do what they want?[p]
[drawfg id=1]
#Kuro
Each unit is under the command of its general, but they won't take any action without your majesty's order.[p]

#Alice
Oh...I didn't expect it to be so tedious.[p]

This bar represents the order in which each unit acts.[p]

Allies are marked in red, and enemies in blue.[p]
When it is your majesty's allied unit's turn, please give your instructions.

#Alice
What exactly do you want me to do?[p]
[drawfg id=1]
#Kuro
Each unit performs two actions each turn.[p]
[drawfg id=0]
#Alice
Two actions? Can they attack twice?[p]
[drawfg id=1]
#Kuro
No, the soldiers will either attack or defend for the first action.[p]
For the second action, the captain will activite their unique ability with an effect that varies depending on the first action.[p]
[drawfg id=0 state=2]
#Alice
Hm... unique ability... this is getting even more complicated.[p]
Explain it more clearly.[p]
[drawfg id=1]
#Kuro
I should have known...that it will be faster for you to just try it out.[p]

Oh, you sure did act twice.[p]
[drawfg id=1]
#Kuro
You attacked last time, but you can also choose to defend.[p]
[drawfg id=0 state=1]
#Alice
Defend? I don't need that.[p]
Only attack！[p]
[drawfg id=1]
#Kuro
Queen Alice, the captain's abilities that are activated for attack and defense are different.[p]
The abilities that are activated when defending are[n]
・Empowering allies[n]
・Debuffing enemies[p]
・Restoring troop counts and ＨＰ[n]
・Delaying enemy actions[p]
You shuold take full advantage of these.[p]
[drawfg id=0 state=0]
#Alice
Hmm, I see...[n]
I'm quite confused.[p]
[drawfg id=1]
#Kuro
Some captains excel at attack while others excel at defense.[p]
By effectively utilizing each captain's unique abilities, you can gain the upper hand in battle.[p]
[drawfg id=0]
#Alice
How do I choose to defend?[p]
[drawfg id=1]
#Kuro
Many captains' "defense" can be activated by selecting allies.[p]
However, there are also "defense" abilities that can be activated by selecting enemies.[p]
[drawfg id=0 state=2]
#Alice
Then, how can I tell the difference between "attack" and "defense"?[p]
[drawfg id=1]
#Kuro
The red button is "Attack".[n]
The blue button is "Defense".[n]
You should be fine if you remember that.[p]
[drawfg id=0 state=0]
#Alice
Hmm...Well, I'll learn as I go.[p]
